## What this is

100xNotes is a **public engineering notebook**.

I’m documenting my learnings during the **100xDevs cohort by Harkirat Singh**, but more importantly, I’m writing down the moments where things stop being fuzzy and start making sense.

This is not a tutorial site.
It’s not a portfolio.
And it’s definitely not optimized for trends or reach.

It’s a place to think clearly, in public.

## Why write this down?

I’m writing this because I don’t trust shallow understanding.

If I can’t explain how something works without hand-waving, I assume I don’t understand it yet.

This notebook is how I test that.  
Every post starts with something I think I understand and ends only once the underlying behavior is clear.



## The kind of learning I care about

I’m interested in **how systems actually work**.

That usually means:
- Leaving the tutorial hell
- Starting from first principles
- Looking at what’s happening on the wire
- Paying attention to boundaries, assumptions, and failure modes
- Removing abstraction until the core idea is visible

If a concept can’t be explained in simple terms, I assume I don’t understand it yet.

This notebook exists to fix that.

## What you’ll find here

You can think of this site as a written trace of everything I learn during the **100xDevs bootcamp**.

As I go through the curriculum primarily **Web2 + DevOps**. I document the concepts that matter, the gaps I notice, and the mental models that finally make things click.

I may later branch into **Web3** or **AI/ML**, but those are intentionally out of scope for now.

This is not a mirror of the syllabus.  
It’s a record of understanding.

You can find the syllabus [here](https://bootcamp.kirat.dev).

## Who this is for

Primarily, this is for me.

Secondarily, it’s for anyone going through 100xDevs or anyone who wants to build understanding that holds up when things break.

I’m learning as I go. This is just me making the process visible.

## Let’s begin

The posts that follow start small.
They zoom in on fundamentals.
And they try to replace vague intuition with clear mental models.

The emphasis is always on clarity over completeness and consistency over motivation.

That’s the only goal of this notebook.
